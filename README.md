# :boom: whats up?

Currently working as an independent consultant. I use my expertise in recommendation systems to helps fast-growing startups build out their RAG applications. I am also the creator of [Instructor](https://jxnl.github.io/instructor), [Flight](https://jxnl.github.io/flight), and an ML and data science educator.

## Support

I want to support me, you can [sponsor me on github](https://github.com/sponsors/jxnl). I don't want to start a substack, but I do want to write more. So this will fund my morning coffee and tea.
